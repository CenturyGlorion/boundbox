boundbox
========

BoundBox provides an easy way to test an object by accessing **all** its fields, constructor and methods, public or not. 
BoundBox breaks encapsulation.

Sample
------

Let's say we have a class A like :

````java
public class A {
 private String foo;
 
 protected A(String foo) {
   this.foo = foo;
 }
 
 private void bar(String foo) {
  this.foo += foo; 
 }
 
 protected String getFoo() {
   return "The value of foo is " + foo;
 }
}
````

With BoundBox, you can write a test that accesses all fields and methods of A :

````java
public class ATest {
 @BoundBox( boundClass = A.class )
 private BoundBoxOfA boundBoxOfA;
 
 @Before
 public void setUp() {
   boundBoxOfA = new BoundBoxOfA( new A("bb") );
 }
 
 @Test
 public void testConstructor() {
   //GIVEN
   //WHEN
   //THEN
   assertEquals( "bb", boundBoxOfA.boundBox_getFoo());
 }
 
 @Test
 public void testBar() {
   //GIVEN
   //WHEN
   boundBoxOfA.bar("cc");
   
   //THEN
   assertEquals( "bbcc", boundBoxOfA.boundBox_getFoo();
 }
 
 @Test
 public void testGetFoo() {
   //GIVEN
   //WHEN
   //THEN
   assertEquals( "The value of foo is bb", boundBoxOfA.getFoo();
 }
}
````

As soon as you type : `@BoundBox(boundClass=A.class)`, the BoundBox annotation processor will generate the class `BoundBoxOfA` that you can use to access all inner fields, constructors and methods of A.

BoundBox API is quite simple. Indeed in has no API at all, just a set of conventions to access the inner structure of an Object.

BoundBox offers the following advantages over alternative technologies : 
* don't pollute your API under tests. Just code clean, don't change anything for testing even not a visibility modifier.
* objects under tests will be accessed using reflection, and this access will be checked at compile time (unlike using pure reflection or WhiteBox from PowerMock).
* all fields, constructors and methods, even those defined in super classes are accessible. For instance, it allows to access `foo.super.super.a`.
